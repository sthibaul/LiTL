What is LiTL?
=============================================
LiTL (or litl) is a lightweight tool for recording events during the execution of scientific high-performance
applications. litl is designed to record events on the user level only. Therefore, it will consume much less
resources (CPU time, memory, and the disk space) as the alternative tools, e.g. FxT, that gather events on both user
and kernel levels. As a result, litl will be well-suited for recording events on embedded systems like ARM
architectures.


Requirements
=============================================
In order to use LiTL, the following software is needed:
    * autoconf 2.63;
    
    * libelf or libbfd. On Debian, libelf can be installed from command line by the following command:
        apt-get install libelf-dev


Getting LiTL
=============================================
Current development version of LiTL is available via Git
    git clone git+ssh://roman@fusionforge.int-evry.fr//var/lib/gforge/chroot/scmrepos/git/evnt/evnt.git

After getting the latest development version (from Git), './bootstrap' should be run in the root directory and only then
the tool can be built.


Building LiTL
=============================================
At first, to configure LiTL the following script should be invoked:
    $ ./configure --prefix=<WHERE_YOU_INSTALL_LITL>

The configuration script contains many different options that can be set. However, we recommend to use the default
settings.

Once LiTL is configured, the next two commands should be run:
    $ make
    $ make install

In order to check whether LiTL was installed correctly, a set of tests can be executed by
    $ make check


How to Use LiTL
=============================================
litl_read
---------

    This tool analyzes a trace produced by LiTL. It shows the recorded events in the following format:
        - the code of the probe
        - the id of the current thread on this CPU
        - the time since last probe record on the same CPU
        - the number of parameters of the probe
        - the list of parameters of the probe, if any

Options:
    -f specify the path to the input trace file

    -h prints some reference help

litl_merge
----------

    This tool merges severals traces into one archive for further processing.

Options:
    -h prints some reference help

litl_split
----------

    This tool splits an archive of traces into separate trace files

Options:
    -h prints some reference help
