What is LiTL?
=============================================
LiTL (or litl) is a lightweight tool for recording events during the execution 
of scientific high-performance applications. litl is designed to record events 
on the user level only. Therefore, it consumes much less resources (CPU time, 
memory, and the disk space) as the alternative tools, e.g. FxT, that gather 
events on both user and kernel levels. As a result, litl is well-suited for 
recording events on embedded systems like ARM architectures.


Requirements
=============================================
In order to use LiTL, the following software is needed:
    * autoconf 2.63;
    
    * libelf or libbfd. On Debian, libelf can be installed from command line by 
      the following command:
        apt-get install libelf-dev


Getting LiTL
=============================================
Current development version of LiTL is available via Git
    git clone git+ssh://roman@fusionforge.int-evry.fr//var/lib/gforge/chroot/
    scmrepos/git/evnt/evnt.git

After getting the latest development version (from Git), './bootstrap' should 
be run in the root directory and only then the tool can be built.


Building LiTL
=============================================
At first, to configure LiTL the following script should be invoked:
    $ ./configure --prefix=<WHERE_YOU_INSTALL_LITL>

The configuration script contains many different options that can be set. 
However, we recommend to use the default settings.

Once LiTL is configured, the next two commands should be run:
    $ make
    $ make install

In order to check whether LiTL was installed correctly, a set of tests can be 
executed by
    $ make check


How to Use LiTL
=============================================
litl_read
---------
    This tool analyzes a trace produced by LiTL. It shows the recorded events 
    in the following format:
        - Time since last probe record on the same CPU    
        - ID of the current thread on this CPU
        - Event type        
        - Code of the probe        
        - Number of parameters of the probe
        - List of parameters of the probe, if any

Options:
    -f  Specify the path to the input trace file
    -h  Prints some reference help

litl_merge
----------
    This tool merges severals traces into one archive for further processing.

Options:
    -o  Specify the path to the output archive of traces
    -h  Prints some reference help    

litl_split
----------
    This tool splits an archive of traces into separate trace files

Options:
    -f  Specify the path to the input archive of traces
    -d  Specify the path to the output directory
    -h  Prints some reference help
